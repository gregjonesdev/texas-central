      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p>
        With a combined population surpassing 13.7 million people, Dallas-Fort
        Worth and Houston represent North America's 5th and 6th largest
        (respectively) metropolitan areas. The economies of both cities are
        projected to continue growing through at least 2050.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distance between Dallas and Houston, about 240 miles, makes
        high-speed rail an attractive option: far enough to offer a substantial
        advantage over driving while close enough to compete with flying. A
        non-stop flight between Houston's IAH and Dallas-Fort Worth's DFW lasts
        approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes. The Japanese-designed N700i
        Shinkansen trains will require only an additional 10 minutes to
        complete the trip.
